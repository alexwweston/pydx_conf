    "## What does OO mean?\n",
    "### Design pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming, or OO, or OOP, is a way to program.\n",
    "It's a design pattern, which is a fancy jargon way of saying that it's a common,\n",
    "repeatable way to organize your code and approach problems. Programming is\n",
    "really just problem solving so OO is a way to solve problems in the greater\n",
    "scheme of programming. It's not *the* way, it's not even *the best* way, but\n",
    "it's a way and, for most people and most problems, it's a really *good* way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Especially handy for real-world concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially true when we're dealing with real-world concepts. Taking a\n",
    "bunch of data and filtering it down, like finding all of the men's shoes that\n",
    "are between `$15` and `$65` isn't really a \"real world\" thing. It's just some work\n",
    "to do. Probably not a good thing to solve with OO.\n",
    "\n",
    "*But*, talking about a shoe, or a store, or a transaction, any of these things\n",
    "are definitely handled well by object-oriented programming. You can make a store\n",
    "object or a shoe object and then do *stuff* with it. Anything you can think of\n",
    "as \"I want to do stuff to this thing\" is usually a good candidate for OO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Everything in Python is an object already\n",
    "\n",
    "And, in the world of Python, everything is an object. Every variable you make,\n",
    "every function, every...everything. Everything is an object so, once you get\n",
    "used to objects and OO, Python starts to make a bit more sense and be a bit more\n",
    "predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects are generally nouns\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is an object? Object is a programming construct that has attributes and\n",
    "methods. Hold onto those words, we'll come back to them. Objects are *usually*\n",
    "nouns. They're *things*. Like I said before, a shoe, a store, a transaction.\n",
    "*Things*. Nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can definitely have objects that represent verbs or adjectives but those are\n",
    "usually a little trickier to keep in your mental map. They don't fit as nicely\n",
    "with my next few analogies, either.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects have attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's go back. I said that objects have attributes. How many of you know\n",
    "what I mean if I say \"namespace\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace is a group of names. Like, in your family, you have names that mean\n",
    "a particular person. Maybe it's \"mom\" or \"dad\" or \"Jake\" or something. In that\n",
    "space, your family, the name \"Anne\" means a particular person. In your work or\n",
    "school namespace, though, \"Anne\" might be a completely different person.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it's pretty much the same thing. In one file, the variable `age`\n",
    "might be 35 and in another one it might be 27. Even inside of that file, the\n",
    "`age` variable in the outermost scope, or the global scope, might be one value\n",
    "but inside of a function, it could be a different one. The function has its own\n",
    "namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have their own namespace, too. Any variables that are just floating\n",
    "around in this namespace are called \"attributes\". Attributes are like, well, the\n",
    "attributes of your object. So if we go back to a shoe, the attributes would be\n",
    "the color, the size, the brand, the model, the lace color and length, and so on.\n",
    "These are kind of the adjectives that describe your object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class vs. an Instance vs. an Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is the \"blueprint\" for an object. You \"instantiate\" many \"instance objects\" (\"instances\" for short) of the class, but there is only one class. Most people use instance and object interchangeably. There is a technical difference between an object and an instance (look [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14802302) if you're interested).\n",
